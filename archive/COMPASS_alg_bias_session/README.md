# Algorithmic Fairness In Practice

This repository houses the materials presented in the the Algorithmic Fairness in Practice tutorial at the (virtual) 2021 ENAR conference.
The first half of the session defines algorithmic fairness and introduces examples of algorithmic bias and where bias can be introduced in the data science workflow. The second half of the session is a hands-on tutorial of detecting the bias of a well-known algorithm used in the U.S. judicial system. Code is provided in R and Python.
